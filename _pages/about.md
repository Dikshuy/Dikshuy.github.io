I am a Master's student in the Computing Science department at the University of Alberta, supervised by [Prof. Matthew Taylor](https://drmatttaylor.net). I completed my bachelor's degree at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) and worked as an AI Researcher at Honda R&D in Japan. My research focuses on developing intelligent, autonomous systems for robust, real-time decision-making in complex, multi-agent environments. I am particularly passionate about autonomous driving and reinforcement learning, and my experience with the self-driving car team at IIT Bombay and at Honda R&D has provided me with a strong foundation in sensor fusion, multi-agent coordination, and practical AI applications.

My ultimate goal is to advance the field of RL by creating agents that can adapt dynamically and coordinate effectively in unpredictable environments. I am particularly interested in exploring how agents can:  
* Learn effective strategies from minimal interactions with their environment,  
* Understand and anticipate the behavior of other agents, and  
* Explore and learn autonomously in a curious and self-driven manner.  

Outside of research, I am an enthusiastic sports lover who enjoys staying active. Whether it's soccer, tennis, badminton, or any outdoor sport, I'm always up for a game. In my free time, I love cooking and listening to music, which helps me relax and recharge.
